            - provide a framework for developers to add temporary controls
            for modification of the run-time behaviour of the application that
            appears as controls on the last tab of the profile preferences
            dialog, includes an example I've been using to render the room
            symbols on the 2D map less than 100% opaque.
mudletDev_fixGSysMessage
            - revision that replaces global gSysMessage with per Host message
            stack to correct an issue when using more than one profile in a

            mudletDev_debugControls branches



mudletDev_proposedUpdates
            - an UNSTABLE (may get rebased so history gets messed up) mash-up
            of other changes merged into one.  Only intended as a demo and may
            (eventually) do things to map/other data files that other versions
            cannot comprehend - don't let it over-right stuff you want to hang-
            on to!
